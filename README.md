The original images are from [TIA](https://archive.org/details/StoryOfChanukah/page/n1/mode/2up).

Proofers, there are a couple of words and phrases in Hebrew. Please mark these as [**Hebrew] since we don't have any character sets supported for Hebrew.

There should be nothing out of the ordinary for Formatters.

If you have any questions, please ask in the project thread.
